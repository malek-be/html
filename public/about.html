<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone,I am malek. A 18 years old student in med college .I am from Algeria and i live in Tipasa 
.I speak 3 languages: French,English,Arabic also working on my German. I consider myself a hard working person that you can count on and a creative person so my sites won't be boring promise :)</p>

<p>Becoming a Web developer has been my dream since i was a kid so that's why i choose to learn it alone because i think it is something doable and you don't need to go to a certain college to learn it.</p>

<p>I am hoping that before the end of the year 2024 i would be able to help people by creating websites for them and to be a famous web developer in the future.
</p>
